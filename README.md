# Lighbulb - Game

This was an university project where the idea was to attempt to use design patterns.\
The project is a small puzzle game with 2 levels that have to be solved using hints on the screen or in the behaviour.\
While developing this project I have tried to maintain a clean architecture to my best knowledge at that time.

Successfull patterns:  
* MVP 
* Singleton

Failed patterns: 
* Decorator
